## Issues
Annoyingly despite my best efforts at the time I was unable to find a solution for making the seed data populate a friends list, due to the nature of it being self referential. Also the randomly generated seed data has a weirdly high chance of generating similar names and crashing the app...but running the seed data again fixes the problem.

## Description
Express + Mongoose implementation for the backend of a 'classic' social media site. Before the days of harvesting userdata and engagement based content algorithms.

## Installation
Installations required: <br />
npm i

## Usage
Be sure to use ```npm run seed``` before starting the application. Seed data is generated randomly.

## Link
This is not a deployed application, however, [here](https://youtu.be/wx9Prif19LA) is a link to a walkthrough video of the application <br />

## Screenshot
Here is a screenshot of the application running. <br /> ![Screenshot]()
